Exploratory data analysis of registered Therapeutic Product (TP)  in Singapore with dataset provided on Data.gov.sg

Being a Pharmacist by training, I am interested in exploring data related to pharmaceuticals in Singapore. I discovered that https://data.gov.sg/ provide many such datasets. Of interest, it also contains Listing of Registered Therapeutic Products. Although the dataset may not be updated (Last updated Nov 2019), nonetheless it still provide a glimpse to the registered pharmaceuticals (defined as 'Therapeutic Products') in Singapore

This repo shares Jupyter notebook and dataset that I used to run the analyses.
